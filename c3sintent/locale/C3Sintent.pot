#. Default: Declaration of Intent to join the Cultural Commons Collecting Society
#. (C3S)
#: c3sintent/templates/intent.pt:14
msgid "membership-form"
msgstr ""

#. Default: When we submit our application for approval as a collecting society at
#. the German Patent and Trademark Office, we must be able to prove the anticipated
#. level of support and acceptance for the time when we commence our business
#. operation. Facebook followers are not sufficient – we need some additional
#. assistance.
#: c3sintent/templates/intent.pt:17
msgid "intent-form-intro-1"
msgstr ""

#. Default: If you are willing to become a member of the C3S after its foundation
#. and wish to entrust the C3S with the commercial utilisation of some or all of
#. your works, you can now declare this intent to the German Patent and Trademark
#. Office. You are allowed to currently be a member of a different collecting
#. society – a transfer is possible, even if it may be a lengthy process. At the
#. moment, you merely confirm that you seriously consider to become a member of the
#. new C3S. Your signature does not constitute a binding agreement to join.
#: c3sintent/templates/intent.pt:20
msgid "intent-form-intro-3"
msgstr ""

#. Default: You have to be a composer, lyricist, musician, music producer, remixer
#. or DJ, and you must have written, or mixed, at least three tracks. This means
#. that you have created, or co-created, not less than three different works of
#. music. We are happy about professionals or semi-professionals, but amateur
#. musicians and prospective artists will also find their home in the C3S – even if
#. you have only just compiled your first remixes or mashups.
#: c3sintent/templates/intent.pt:24
msgid "intent-form-intro-4"
msgstr ""

#. Default: After the C3S has been founded, we will use your data to ask you
#. whether you really want to become a member. If not, your declaration will be
#. deleted. It will also be deleted if you have second thoughts and notify us in
#. writing that you wish to withdraw your declaration.
#: c3sintent/templates/intent.pt:27
msgid "intent-form-intro-5"
msgstr ""

#. Default: In order to prevent falsifications, we will ask you not only for your
#. name, but also for your e-mail and postal addresses, as it is done in petitions,
#. too. Of course we will only use your data for the application to the  German
#. Patent and Trademark Office and will neither pass them on to third parties, nor
#. use them for other purposes, or publish them. They will be stored in Germany by
#. the registered association OpenMusicContest.org as representative of the C3S
#. foundation initiative, according to the requirements of the Federal Data
#. Protection Act.
#: c3sintent/templates/intent.pt:30
msgid "intent-form-intro-6"
msgstr ""

#. Default: By sending an e-mail to data@c3s.cc you may order your data to be
#. deleted at any time, and without giving reasons. Upon request to the same
#. address, you may also ask for information about the data we have stored about
#. you. However, a deletion of your data will have the result that we can not get
#. in touch with you, should you wish to join the collecting society. You can read
#. the details about how we handle your data (Data Protection Declaration)
#. separately on our website at
