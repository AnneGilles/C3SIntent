	After submitting the form below, you will be presented with a PDF download (~90 KB) with your data filled in. Please print out at least the second and third page. Take your time and read them carefully - and don't forget to sign! Send both (!) pages scanned or printed to C3S. Please find the addresses on the first page. We will receive your data via encrypted email -- and then wait for your signature to make it valid!

    <p i18n:translate="intent-form-intro-1">
      When we submit our application for approval as a collecting society at the German Patent and Trademark Office, we must be able to prove the anticipated level of support and acceptance for the time when we commence our business operation. Facebook followers are not sufficient – we need some additional assistance.
    </p>
    <p i18n:translate="intent-form-intro-2">
      If you are willing to become a member of C3S after its foundation and wish to entrust C3S with the commercial utilisation of some or all of your works, you can now declare this intent to the German Patent and Trademark Office.
    </p>
    <p i18n:translate="intent-form-intro-3">
You are allowed to currently be a member of a different collecting society – a transfer is possible, even if it may be a lengthy process. At the moment, you merely confirm that you seriously consider to become a member of the new C3S. Your signature does not constitute a binding agreement to join.
    </p>
    <p i18n:translate="intent-form-intro-4">
      You have to be a composer, lyricist, musician, music producer, remixer or DJ, and you must have written, produced, performed, or mixed, at least three tracks. This means that you have created, or co-created, not less than three different works of music. We are happy about professionals or semi-professionals, but amateur musicians and prospective artists will also find their home in C3S – even if you have only just compiled your first remixes or mashups.
    </p>
    <p i18n:translate="intent-form-intro-5">
      After C3S has been founded, we will use your data to ask you whether you really want to become a member. If not, your declaration will be deleted. It will also be deleted if you have second thoughts and notify us in writing that you wish to withdraw your declaration.
    </p>
    <p i18n:translate="intent-form-intro-6">
      In order to prevent falsifications, we will ask you not only for your name, but also for your email and postal addresses, as it is done in petitions, too. Of course we will only use your data for the application to the German Patent and Trademark Office and will neither pass them on to third parties, nor use them for other purposes, or publish them. They will be stored in Germany by the registered association OpenMusicContest.org as representative of the C3S foundation initiative, according to the requirements of the Federal Data Protection Act. 
    </p>
    <p i18n:translate="intent-form-intro-7">
By sending an email to data@c3s.cc you may order your data to be deleted at any time, and without giving reasons. Upon request to the same address, you may also ask for information about the data we have stored about you. However, a deletion of your data will have the result that we can not get in touch with you, should you wish to join the collecting society. You can read the details about how we handle your data (Data Protection Declaration) separately on our website at
